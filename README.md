# Arkanoid-Game
This project was developed as part of my Object-Oriented Programming course at Bar-Ilan University. The goal was to design and implement an Arkanoid game using object-oriented principles, applying several design patterns to ensure modularity and flexibility. I used a GUI implementation provided by the course instructors.
## Game Descripition:
This Arkanoid-like consists of three levels, each one progressively harder than the last.
The Player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen and bouncing balls to destroy the blocks.
Completing a level requires breaking all the bricks without letting the ball fall out of the screen.
## Levels:
### Level 1
A warmup level with one block and one ball.</br>

### Level 2
You control a huge paddle with multiple balls, making it more challenging to manage.</br>

### Level 3
The final and most difficult level with a smaller paddle and two balls. Youâ€™ll need to stay sharp to beat this!</br>
