# Arkanoid-Game
This project was developed as part of my Object-Oriented Programming course at Bar-Ilan University.
The goal was to design and implement an Arkanoid game using object-oriented principles.
## Game Descripition:
This Arkanoid-like consists of three levels, each one progressively harder than the last.
The Player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen and bouncing balls to destroy the blocks.
Completing a level requires breaking all the bricks without letting the ball fall out of the screen.
## Levels
### Level 1:
A warmup level with one single block and one ball.
